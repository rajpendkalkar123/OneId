# OneID – Decentralized Digital Identity 🌐🔐

OneID is a **Web3-powered decentralized digital identity (DID) platform** that enables secure, seamless, and privacy-first login across multiple platforms. With OneID, users can authenticate once and use the same DID to access **social media, banking, e-commerce, government services, and third-party apps** — without oversharing sensitive personal data.
